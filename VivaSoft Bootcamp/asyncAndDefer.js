/*
Async => 
async allows the script to be downloaded in the background without blocking. Then, the moment it finishes
downloading, rendering is blocked and that script executes. Render resumes when the script has executed.
*/

/*
Defer =>
Basically, defer tells the browser to wait "until it's ready" before executing the javascript in that script 
block. Usually this is after the DOM has finished loading and document.readyState == 4.
